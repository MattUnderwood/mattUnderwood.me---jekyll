title: Building Ubud Taxi Service - Part 1
category: Web Development
excerpt: I recently visited the island of Bali (located in Indonesia). During my time there I met an awesome taxi driver named Dewa that was struggling to keep up with the changing technologies that his customers were using to arrange their transporation while in Bali. This interaction spurred me to create a website for Dewa to help him compete with the changing transporation landscape in Bali. Check out this post to learn more about the website I created and the process/technologies I used to get everything up and running.

<h3>Backstory</h3>
During my recent travels I visited Ubud, Bali. Once of the first things I noticed before even arriving in Bali was that my cabride from the airport to my homestay was going to cost about $25 USD. This seemed like a very high amount compared to the cost of other local goods and services - especially since the ride would take less than an hour. I shopped around before accepting the fare and discovered it was the going rate for the area. 

The taxi situation in Ubud was not ideal and they charge extortionate amounts for transportation. I had heard about this before arriving so I pre-arranged a taxi from the airport with my homestay which cost (300k - a little bit cheaper than the usual 350k). Since I got in so late (around 2AM) I didn’t need any additional transportation until the morning. When I woke up I spoke with Nyoman (an employee and amazing breakfast cook) and he helped me arrange a scooter rental directly across the street. I agreed to a price of 50k per day for a length of 5 days. As you can see, scooter rentals are significantly cheaper than using a taxi, and the cost of fuel is extremely low.

This means that taxi drivers are getting less and less fares. What's made it even worse for the local taxi drivers is the rise of ride-sharing apps like Grab and GO-JEK (the Asian equivalent of Uber and Lyft). Although I completely support ridesharing apps (I think they increase competition, make the market pricing fairer, and end up creating better overall service for riders), they are banned and pushed out of most cities in Bali by local taxi unions. 

Dewa recognized that the taxi industry (something he’s been involved with for over 15 years) is quickly changing, and he is having a hard time keeping up. He was worried that he may have to sell his vehicle if he can’t start making more money, and this would make it very difficult to transport his family of 6 around since they can’t all fit on a scooter (and it’s dangerous). The catalyst for this change in the industry is technology. The majority of taxi requests are now coming through websites, online referrals, and WhatsApp.

Dewa explained that in order to find a customer he has to solicit them on the streets (which makes sense now after being asked if I wanted a cab about 50 times while in Ubud) or receive an “overflow” request from one of his friends. A few of his friends have been able to set up websites or receive a lot of mentions of their service through online services like TripAdvisor, Facebook, etc. They’ve utilized technology to gain an advantage over their competitors, and its working out extremely well for them. 

When Dewa receives an “overflow” request (meaning that his friends have received more taxi inquiries than they can handle themselves) he is essentially subcontracted to perform the work. This seems great at the surface but the people with the overflow requests are not generous. My trip from Ubud to Canggu with Dewa cost 350k and Dewa said he would only receive 100k of the fair. He explained that he was driving his own car and using his own fuel (neither of these are provided by the person that provided the request). This pissed me off since that is not even close to a fair “finders fee”. I think that a fair finders fee would be between 10% and 30% of the total fare (in this case Dewa would keep between 315k or 245k).  

Dewa is relied upon to support his family of 6 as the sole income earner. This is getting more and more difficult and he doesn’t know what he’ll do next if his taxi income continues to decline. 

As we got to talking I let him know that I’m learning how to build websites and previously worked in digital marketing. I said I would like to help him with his problem, and if he is interested I would do it free of cost (with the idea that the most I would accept from him is repayment for the domain and monthly server fees. I would also be okay accepting free lodging, food, and trips throughout Bali from him if I visit again in the future - something he offered even before I did any work on the website). He sounded excited and we tossed around a few names and ideas. 

In summary, the taxi situation in Ubud isn’t right and I’m going to build a website free of cost for Dewa and turn it into the number 1 search result on google for “Ubud Taxi” and “Ubud Taxi Service” (and likely many other search terms). Once the site is established and doing well I will get him the number 1 result on Google Maps (which is where I found my taxi), and continue to pursue digital marketing through Facebook and potentially Google Adwords. I already checked out the competition, and I’m confident that I can make a better website for Dewa. 


<h3>Research, Design, and Coding</h3>

After performing some basic keyword research and checking the keywords against the .com domains that are available, I found that “Ubud Taxi”, “Taxi Ubud”, and “Ubud Taxi Service” (and variations of these names) consistently score high in the keyword search rankings. The first two terms are already taken, but “Ubud Taxi Service” is available. I think this domain can reach the top of Googles search results if I focus on search engine optimization (SEO). 

I bought the domain right away (ubudTaxiService.com) and am excited to start and finish this project so I can help Dewa support his family. I’m going to start basic and make a slick responsive design from a mobile first design perspective. I assume most tourists are searching for cabs while they are on the go and that they don’t have laptops with them. For these reasons, I will design the website for a mobile first experience (while still providing a great tablet/desktop experience through responsive design). 

I plan to break the site into 5 main categories: Home, About, Services, Photo Gallery, and Contact. 

A blog could also potentially be added to the site if I have trouble breaking into the search results or if competition increases overtime, but based on the current competition, I don’t think this is necessary right now. 

I want to keep the design simple and easily navigable for potential customers. I think most customers will appreciate a well designed website and this alone could be the difference for which cab service they choose (I know when I’m traveling that I typically associate a well designed website with a well thought out and polished business model - this has proven true many times for me). 

Once I get a nice layout and basic content generated I’m going to show the site to Dewa, and then work on producing additional content and tweaking the site to include information about Dewa and Ubud. I worked on the site for about 4 or 5 hours once I got to the Airbnb and pretty much cooped myself up in my room until it was in decent shape. I’m starting to add some basic content and am removing the lorem ipsum placeholders I started with. Things are shaping up quick and I could have a solid site ready to go live within the next week or so. 

I’m running into an issue where the placeholder photos from the “portfolio”/”review” section that are randomly generated by unsplash aren’t loading. I need to look into this or just download one photo and duplicate for each tab so that it successfully loads and I can phase them out with the pictures Dewa provides me. I also want to change a few basic styling elements that are located at the top of the page. 

After getting the basic design coded up and layed out, I decided to implement a “hamburger” navigation menu. The menu I’m currently using doesn’t look very good and takes up a lot of space on mobile devices. It isn’t terrible but I think it will be a fun challenge to implement the new navigation style. I used a tutorial titled “Responsive Menu With Media Queries (Checkbox Trick) - Using Only CSS3 Tutorial“ from Youtube. It was pretty straight forward and I implemented it the same way they did, but now need to go back through to cancel out some of the CSS Grid and other styling that was previously applied to the navigation menu. 

I put in quite a bit of additional work into the site and figured out the hamburger menu. I also optimized the navigation menu so its colors are slightly different than the rest of the page. I think this helps it stand out more. I added the navigation menu as a sticky to the top of the page and it stays with the user as they scroll down. I also added a bit of javascript styling so that the links are colored when the user hovers over them. When I added the sticky navigation bar to the site I also had to provide padding to the on-page links so the navbar wouldn’t cover content when the link was clicked. This all proved to be slightly complex, but it was nothing I couldn’t figure out with some thinking and a few well worded Google searches. 

After accomplishing so much yesterday I was ready to keep it going and continue fixing/optimizing things up today. I started by upgrading my hosting plan with StableHost and pointing the nameservers on NameCheap to the right location so my site would work. After that I started looking into very minor CSS changes that needed to be made. This included removing pictures that caused the screen to be “off-set” when things were resized with the media queries, and fixing the navbar so that its sizing was correct with the different media queries. I sent Dewa a message on WhatsApp when the site was live, and he didn’t respond for a bit but eventually got back to me saying to keep going for it and to do whatever I think the next logical steps are (in less words - I don’t think his reading/writing is very advanced, which is obviously one of the hardest parts of learning a new language). 

I guess he is a bit more excited than I initially expected. He sent me 10 pictures of happy customers and then a bunch of pictures of him and his children (which I plan to add to the about page). I’m excited to hook Dewa up with this website and I really think I can change his life/income drastically. I asked for captions/locations of where the photos were taken so I can name them properly and create alt tags for them. I could upload the images now, but I’d rather wait until I have the correct information (it will be less work).
